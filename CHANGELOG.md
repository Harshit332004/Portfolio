# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - Initial Portfolio Implementation

### Added
- **Core Architecture**: Modular Flutter Web portfolio with clean separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Riverpod implementation for theme and portfolio data management
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 600px, 1024px, and 1440px
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode with system preference detection and persistence
- **Navigation**: Responsive navigation with desktop navbar and mobile drawer
- **Hero Section**: Animated hero with typed text, parallax effects, and glassmorphism design

### Architecture Decisions

#### State Management: Riverpod over Provider
- **Decision**: Chose Riverpod for state management
- **Rationale**: Better performance, compile-time safety, and more intuitive API
- **Implementation**: Used StateNotifierProvider for theme management and Provider for portfolio data

#### Responsive Design Strategy
- **Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with explicit breakpoints
- **Rationale**: Ensures optimal experience across all devices while maintaining design integrity
- **Implementation**: ResponsiveUtils class with static methods for consistent breakpoint handling

#### Animation Architecture
- **Decision**: Multi-layered animation system with staggered entrances and scroll triggers
- **Rationale**: Creates engaging user experience while maintaining performance
- **Implementation**: AnimationController pattern with VisibilityDetector for scroll-triggered animations

#### Theme Implementation
- **Decision**: Comprehensive theme system with custom color schemes and typography
- **Rationale**: Professional appearance with consistent design language
- **Implementation**: AppTheme class with light/dark variants and gradient definitions

#### Data Structure
- **Decision**: Structured data models for portfolio content
- **Rationale**: Easy to update content and integrate with LaTeX parsing
- **Implementation**: PortfolioData model with JSON serialization support

### Technical Implementation

#### Performance Considerations
- Used RepaintBoundary for complex animations
- Implemented proper disposal of AnimationControllers
- Optimized rebuilds with Riverpod's selective state updates

#### Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast ratios in both themes

#### Web Optimization
- Flutter Web-specific optimizations
- Responsive image handling
- Efficient asset loading
